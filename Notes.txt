Notes: FileSystem delegates to folder who does the work

Creating Folders:
- IFileSystem.CreateFolder(AbsoluteFolderPath) => Task<IFoldaer> //recursive build up
	ram:\ each folder registers as it is created, with parent and filesystem
- IFolder.CreateFolder(string) => Task<IFolder> //only single child folder
	ram:\ single folder registers with parent and filesystem

Deleting Folders: all folder deletes are recursive
- IFileSystem.DeleteFolder(AbsoluteFolderPath) => Task
	ram:\ start at the leafs and delete back up (recursive)
- IFolder.Delete() => Task
	ram:\ start at the leafs and delete back up (recursive)

======

Creating Files:
- IFileSystem.CreateFile(AbsoluteFilePath, CollisionStrategy) => Task<IFile>
- IFolder.CreateFile()

Deleting Files:
- IFileSystem.DeleteFile(AbsoluteFilePath) => Task
- IFolder.DeleteFile(AbsoluteFilePath) => Task
- IFile.Delete() => Task

Disk.. do we need to check Exists before Delete()?
